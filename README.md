# Terrarium cup holder
Cup Holders for 50mm radius food cups, e.g. for a terrarium.

## Cups
I'm using 50mm metal cups in this cup holder. The only requirement is a small rim around the top of the cup to keep it from falling through.
The holder should be easily modifyable for other cup sizes.

## Suction cups

The cup holders were designed with DIYexpert 50mm suction cups in mind. Though any other suction cup or other attachment methods should also work.
